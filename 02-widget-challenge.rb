# Widget Data Challenge

# In this challenge, use the core Ruby File library https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/File.html (not the CSV library) to manipulate csv data.

# Download the following files and save them to your project directory...
# - widget data file (widget-data-in.csv).
# - Widget class definition (widget.rb).

# Open widget-data-in.csv in append mode and append the following string to the data file (note the carriage return character)...
# widget101,stupendous,99,2,13,5,3.5\n

# Open widget-data-in.csv in read mode and do the following...
# - read the column headers into an array of strings.
# - read the column values into an array of strings.

# Create an array of widget objects from the collected data.

# Print the instance count of widgets.

# Print the array of widgets.

# Set the id of each widget object - this should be unique, starting at 1, in increments of 1.

# Open a new file called widget-data-out.csv in write mode, and save the data from each widget object, including the new header.
